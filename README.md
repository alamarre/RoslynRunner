# RoslynRunner

This is a set of tools to make it easier to build and debug with Roslyn. 
It is intended to reduce cycle time and complexity of automated 
refactoring, and to make it reasonably easy to debug Roslyn analyzers and 
incremental generators.

## Usage
See the [running the tool](./documentation/running-the-tool.md) documentation, or look at the [LegacyWebApp sample documentation](./samples/LegacyWebApp), for how to work with the tool.
